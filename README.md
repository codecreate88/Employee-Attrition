# Employee-Attrition
To Predict Employee Attrition on Fictional Dataset from IBM Data Scientists

Using data from a fictional dataset provided by IBM data scientists, four supervised machine learning algorithms in Python were used to train the models and predict employee attrition: 
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors 
3. Decision Tree 
4. Random Forest 

After fitting the models, 4 fictitious characters were created and their probabilities of attrition were predicted using the 4 models.
